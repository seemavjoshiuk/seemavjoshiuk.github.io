My Portfolio

This is my first attempt at using HTML and CSS in order to create a 3 page website to a given specification.

I have found this to be quite challenging and I have had to learn a lot on the spot in order to get close to the given specification.

This portfolio will be ever evolving, and as I upskill, I intend to ensure this page reflects this.

I have learnt that google is my best friend, and with time and practice I can learn almost anything (HTML/CSS related, of course!)

So, here's to the beginning of my coding journey!

I'd like to thank my colleagues, lecturer, TA's and SSM for all their support and assistance so far.
